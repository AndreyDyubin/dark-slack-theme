Chrome and Firefox extension for a dark theme for slack.

NOTE for people wondering why colours have changed:

I have got tired of trying to keep up with slacks constant css breaking so have scrapped it and used a more holistic approach 
 borrowed from darkreader, its a great extension and if you can use that for all your web browsing you wont need this one.
